 * - Your system is a bare-metal system (probably with an RTOS)
 *   and interrupts are under your control:
 *   Implement this as LockInterrupts() / UnlockInterrupts()
 * - Your system uses an RTOS with deferred interrupt handling from a
 *   worker thread: Implement as a global mutex or lock/unlock scheduler
 * - Your system uses a high-level OS with e.g. POSIX signals:
 *   Implement as a global mutex
